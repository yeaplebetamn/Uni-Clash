***************
FIRST ITERATION

User Stories succesfully implemented included: 1, 2, 3, 8, 11. Most of the implementations where mainly UI set up for the different menus and did not go into the game mechanics of the game.
User story 1
  We are succesfully able to open the app (without it crashing!) and display our basic MainMenu.class.
  From the MainMenu, user can open the SettingsMenu and the TeamSelectMenu
  We plan to update its graphics and "make it prettier" in a later iteration.
User story 2
  We succesfully built a skeleton menu for where the game will be "housed" in GameView.class
  As of now, no matter what Level is selected in LevelSelect, it brings the user to the same skeleton menu which was purposful as we will not implment the actual game levels with game mechanics until a later iteration.
  Evenutally the game will be shown here.
 User story 3
  We succesfully implemented a SettingsMenu in which the default is Rams (go Rams) but the user can choose between Spiders, Hokies, or Rams.
  When selected, these buttons set up a file with the corresponding team name.
 User story 8
  We
 User story 11

 Difficulties: 
  Activity switching was fairly difficult to implement. 
    We started by setting up all menus of the game and implemented the activity switching later. Because of this, some of the menu default UI we used from Android Studio needed to be edited before the Activity Switches could occur.
  Espresso testing was at times difficult to begin to set up but once up and running was not difficult to implement.
