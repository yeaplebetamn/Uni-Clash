We will be working on User Stories:

#1: As a user when I open the app I want a menu to be displayed so that I can start the game and adjust settings.
#2: As a user, when I press play I want it to start the game.
#3: As a user when choosing a team I want to choose from: Spiders, Hokies, or Rams so that I can defeat the rival teams.
#8: As a user I would like to press buttons in between waves so that I can access the menus (shop, pause)
#11: As a gamer I want to see the health of my base so that I can know my status.
